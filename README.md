# Formidable Forms Custom Global Login Message
This Wordpress plugin changes the Formidable Forms global login message, which is displayed to logged out users when form permissions are set to "Logged in" and is usually set under Global Settings / Message Defaults, to include a login link with a redirect back to the user's pre-login location.
